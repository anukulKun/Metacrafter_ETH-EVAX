# Metacrafter_ETH-EVAX

This project involves the development of a decentralized application (DApp) with a smart contract that manages a balance. The smart contract allows users to deposit, withdraw, and reset the balance, ensuring the integrity of operations using Solidity's require(), assert(), and revert() functions.

## Description

The Metacrafter_ETH-EVAX project demonstrates the use of Solidity for creating a smart contract that handles financial transactions. It is designed to show how to implement basic financial operations with safety checks to ensure the integrity of the contract's state. This project is a great starting point for understanding how to manage state and ensure correct operation in Ethereum smart contracts.
